One of my resolutions for last year was to start writing to document the things I learn
and share my thoughts and opinions on tech related topics I find interesting. Unfortunately,
I struggled to find a good workflow and platform to keep myself motivated.

After a lot of research and experimentation, I've settled on a platform that's easy to set up,
maintain, and publish. The source code for this project (this site) is available [here](https://github.com/sakeththota/skth).

## Astro
Astro is a web framework that pioneers a frontend architecture called islands. Islands
strip all non-essential JavaScript from the page reducing overhead, increasing perfomance
and making Astro perfect for static sites like my portfolio. It even ships with Markdown
support and a file-based routing system for a seamless experience writing and publishing a post.

For a very quick and basic setup, we can use the `create astro` CLI to create a new project and start
writing immediately. Simply run `npm create astro@latest` to bootstrap a new project, and create
new blog posts in the `src/pages` directory.

```md title="src/pages/post-1.md"
---
title: Hello, World
---

# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
```

And that's it! By default this Markdown file creates a page at `/post-1`.

## MDX and Content Collections
This is a good start, but there's 2 main reasons I wanted to use Astro that we haven't touched on:
MDX and Content Collections.

**MDX** is a superset of Markdown that lets users embed JSX components directly in your Markdown files.
With MDX, we can create custom components to extend the functionality of our blog posts. For example,
If we have want to embed a tweet but want to have interactivity and not just a screenshot, we
can use [Vercels React Tweet](https://react-tweet.vercel.app/) component directly in our markdown.
To use MDX in Astro, run `npx astro add mdx` and begin using `.mdx` files.

**Content Collections** are a type-safe way to organize content and data in an Astro project. Content
refers to any `.md` or `mdx`, and data refers to any `.yaml` or `json`. In Astro, any directories in the
reserved `src/content` are automatically treated as content collections. To get all the type-safe goodness
Astro provides, lets use zod and define a TypeScript-first schema for our blog post frontmatter.

```ts title="src/content/config.ts"
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content';

export const collections = {
  'blog': defineCollection({
    type: 'content',
    schema: z.object({
      title: z.string(),
      description: z.string(),
      publishedAt: z.string(),
      tags: z.array(z.string()),
      draft: z.boolean(),
    }),
  }),
};
```

From here we can move our posts to `src/content/blog` and query our collection to generate the routes needed
for our blog's static content.

```astro title="src/pages/posts/[...slug].astro"
---
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const blogEntries = await getCollection('blog');
  return blogEntries.map(entry => ({
    params: { slug: entry.slug }, props: { entry },
  }));
}

const { entry } = Astro.props;
const { Content } = await entry.render();
---
<h1>{entry.data.title}</h1>
<Content />
```

Alongside blog related Markdown content, I also use content collections to store my portfolio projects in a
collection of `.yaml` files. The files contain metadata that I use in the Project component, and the 
result is full TypeScript support when I query the collection, including property autocompletion and type-checking.

## Extend w/ LaTeX and Expressive Code
I often include LaTeX snippets in my posts but Astro doesn't currently support it. To add support, we can
use remark with its math and rehype-katex plugins to parse LaTeX snippets and render them as SVGs. Just run
`npm install remark-math rehype-katex` and add the following to your `astro.config.mjs` and `index.astro`.
```js title="astro.config.mjs" ins={4-10}
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
    markdown: {
        remarkPlugins: [
            'remark-math',
        ],
        rehypePlugins: [
            ['rehype-katex', {}]
        ]
    }
});
```
<br />
```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" ins={4-5}
<html lang='en'>
    <head>
        <!-- Katex -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.15.2/dist/katex.min.css"
            integrity="sha384-MlJdn/WNKDGXveldHDdyRP1R4CTHr3FeuDNfhsLPYrq2t0UBkUdK2jyTnXPEK1NQ" crossorigin="anonymous">
    </head>
    <body>
        <slot />
    </body>
</html>
```

Code Blocks are already supported by Astro's Markdown parser, but I wanted to add additional functionality like file
names, line highlighting, and copy buttons. [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/) is a great integration of this that we can add to our
Astro project by running `npx astro add expressive-code`. The result are the pretty code blocks you see in this post!
