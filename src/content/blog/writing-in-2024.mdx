One of my resolutions for last year was to start writing to document the things I learn
and share my thoughts and opinions on tech related topics I find interesting. Unfortunately,
I struggled to find a good workflow and platform to keep myself motivated.

After a lot of research and experimentation, I've settled on a platform that's easy to set up,
maintain, and publish. The source code for this project (this site) is available [here](https://github.com/sakeththota/skth).

## Astro
Astro is a web framework that pioneers a frontend architecture called islands. Islands
strip all non-essential JavaScript from the page reducing overhead, increasing perfomance
and making Astro perfect for static sites like my portfolio. It even ships with Markdown
support and a file-based routing system for a seamless experience writing and publishing a post.

## Quick Setup
For a very quick and basic setup, you can use the `create astro` CLI to create a new project and start
writing immediately. Simply run `npm create astro@latest` to bootstrap a new project, and create
new blog posts in the `src/pages` directory.

*example from [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#file-based-routing)*

```md title="src/pages/post-1.md"
---
title: Hello, World
---

# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
```

And that's it! By default this Markdown file creates a page at `/post-1`.

## Extend w/ Content Collections and MDX
This is a good start, but there's 2 main reasons I wanted to use Astro that we haven't touched on:
Content Collections and MDX.

**MDX** is a superset of Markdown that lets users embed JSX components directly in your Markdown files.
With MDX, we can create custom components to extend the functionality of our blog posts. For example,
If we have want to embed a tweet but don't want to have interactivity and not just a screenshot, we
can use [Vercels React Tweet](https://react-tweet.vercel.app/) component directly in our markdown.
To use MDX in Astro, we can simply run `npx astro add mdx` and begin using `.mdx` files.

**Content Collections** are a type-safe way to organize content and data in an Astro project. In an 
astro project, we can place content (.md/.mdx) or data (.yaml/.json) files into the `src/content`
