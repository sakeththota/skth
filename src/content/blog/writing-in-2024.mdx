One of my resolutions for last year was to start writing to document the things I learn
and share my thoughts and opinions on tech related topics I find interesting. Unfortunately,
I struggled to find a good workflow and platform to keep myself motivated.

After a lot of research and experimentation, I've settled on a platform that's easy to set up,
maintain, and publish.

## Astro
Astro is a web framework that pioneers a frontend architecture called islands. Islands
strip all non-essential JavaScript from the page reducing overhead, increasing perfomance
and making Astro perfect for static sites like my portfolio. It even ships with Markdown
support and a file-based routing system for a seamless experience writing and publishing a post.

## Quick Setup
For a very quick and basic setup, you can use the `create astro` CLI to create a new project and start
writing immediately. Simply run `npm create astro@latest` to bootstrap a new project, and create
new blog posts in the `src/pages` directory.

*example from [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#file-based-routing)*

```md title="src/pages/post-1.md"
---
title: Hello, World
---

# Hi there!

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
```

And that's it! By default this Markdown file creates a page at `/post-1`.
